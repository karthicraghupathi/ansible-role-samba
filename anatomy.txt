defaults
- The defaults directory is designated for variable defaults that take the lowest precedence.
- Put another way: If a variable is defined nowhere else, the definition given in defaults/main.yml will be used.

files and templates
- files contain affiliated files that are used within the role.
- templates contain Ansible templates that are used within the role.
- Ansible does not need a path for resources stored in them when working in the role. Ansible checks them first.
- You may still use the full path if you want to reference files outside of the role.

handlers
- Directory to store Ansible handlers.
- Handlers are tasks that may be flagged during a play to run at a play's completion.

meta
- Directory contains authorship information.
- Useful when publishing your role to Ansible galaxy.
- Also used to define role dependencies. This allows other roles to be installed prior to the current role.

tasks
- Directory where plays for your role are written.
- Ideally, each logically related series of tasks would be laid out in their own files,
  and simply included through the main.yml file in the tasks directory.

vars
- Create variable files that define necessary variables for your role.
- The variables defined in this directory are meant for role internal use only.
- It is a good idea to namespace your role variable names, to prevent potential naming conflicts with variables outside of your role.
- For example, if you needed a variable named config_file in your baseline playbook,
  you may want to name your variable baseline_config_file, to avoid conflicts with another possible config_file variable defined elsewhere.
